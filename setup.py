    description='This project demonstrates the implementation of a robust MLOps pipeline to classify academic success using machine learning techniques. By leveraging an academic success dataset, we explore data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment within a streamlined MLOps framework. The project showcases end-to-end automation, ensuring efficient model development, continuous integration, continuous deployment, and monitoring to maintain high model performance in predicting student success outcomes.',
